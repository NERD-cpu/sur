Welcome to Sur's documentation!
===============================

Sur is python library to calculate and plot envelopes and flashes for multicompound mixtures using equation of states.

It have been designed to be easy to use interactively, for example using `Juputer <http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, although it could be used as a \"backend\" to develop your own programs.
